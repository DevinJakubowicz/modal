		<p class="scroll-box margin"><strong>Add</strong> the water, salt, oil, flour and yeast to your bread machine in the order listed. Select the dough cycle. Check your dough after it has been mixing a few minutes. If it is too dry and not mixing, add water 1 tablespoon at a time, until it is mixing and has a nice dough consistency. You want the dough to be pliable but not sticky.

		<br>

		<strong>Meanwhile</strong>, in a small bowl, combine tomato paste, water, and 3/4 of the package of taco seasoning mix. Stir in chili powder and cayenne pepper; set aside. In another bowl, mix refried beans, salsa, and onion; set aside. In a large skillet, cook ground beef until evenly brown; drain excess fat. Season with the remaining 1/4 package of taco seasoning and a small amount of water. Simmer a few minutes, then remove from heat.

		<strong>Preheat</strong> oven to 400 defrees F (200 degrees C)

		<br>

		<strong>When</strong> the dough cycle is finished, remove the dough from the machine. Divide the dough in half, and pat into two 12 inch pans. Spread a layer of the bean mixture on, then a layer of the tomato mixture. Sprinkle with seasoned beef and top with cheddar cheese.

		<h2 id="spacing-seven">Italian Calzone</h2>
		<img id="stretch-six" src="https://www.hy-vee.com/webres/Image/Recipes/Spicy-italian-calzones.jpg">

		<p class="scroll-box margin"><strong>To</strong> Make Dough: In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add the oil, sugar and salt; mix in 1 cup of the flour until smooth. Gradually stir in the rest of the flour, until dough is smooth and workable. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes, or until it is elastic. Lay dough in a bowl containing 1 teaspoon olive oil, then flip the dough, cover and let rise for 40 minutes, or until almost doubled.

		<br>

		<strong>To</strong> Make Filling: While dough is rising, combine the ricotta cheese, Cheddar cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms and basil leaves in a large bowl. Mix well, cover bowl and refrigerate to chill.

		<br>

		<strong>Preheat</strong> oven to 350 defrees F (190 degrees C)

		<br>

		<strong>When</strong> dough is ready, punch it down and separate it into 2 equal parts. Roll parts out into thin circles on a lightly floured surface. Fill each circle with 1/2 of the cheese/meat filling and fold over, securing edges by folding in and pressing with a fork. Brush the top of each calzone with egg and place on a lightly greased cookie sheet.

		<br>

		<strong>Bake</strong> at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Serve hot.
